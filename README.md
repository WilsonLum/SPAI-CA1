## PART A: CLASSIFICATION 
### Background
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

## PART B: REGRESSION 
### Background
The data is related to posts published during the year of 2014 on the Facebook's page of a renowned cosmetics brand. This dataset contains 500 of the 790 rows and part of the features analyzed by Moro et al. (2016).

This study presents a research approach using datamining for predicting the performance metrics of posts published in brands' Facebook pages. Twelve posts' performance metrics extracted from a cosmetic company's page including 790 publications were modelled, with the two best results achieving a mean absolute percentage error of around 27%.
